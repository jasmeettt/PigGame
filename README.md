## Game Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.
- If the player rolls a 1, all their round score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.

## How to Play

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and accumulate your round score.
- Click the "Hold" button to add your round score to your total score and end your turn.
- The game will automatically switch to the next player after you hold or roll a 1.
